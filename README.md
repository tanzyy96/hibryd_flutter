# ðŸ‘‹bryd_flutter

A Flutter App based for ðŸ‘‹bryd

## Getting Started

This current project is pretty barebone right now, but you'd require Flutter(duh) to run it. If you wish to download and install Flutter, you can visit [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). If you are coming from a React Native background and wish to learn about Flutter and Dart, there's an amazing documentation [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/flutter-for/react-native-devs).

Currently no backend exists so there's that. All you have to do is do `flutter run` and it should run properly.
